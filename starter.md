Create a complete **Next.js + Tailwind CSS** project for a **visually impressive personal RPG dashboard** that tracks XP and progress across real-life domains (e.g., coding, strength, cardio).

---

### ‚ú® Theme & Style
- Design it like a **video game stats screen**, with:
  - Clean **dark theme** (default)
  - Glowing XP bars with animation
  - Animated hover effects and soft transitions
  - Cards with glassmorphism or frosted blur
  - Retro pixel/arcade or cyberpunk-inspired typography

---

### üß© Pages

1. **`/` (Dashboard)**
   - Display XP bars for each domain (Leetcode, Strength, Cardio, etc.)
   - Show **Level** (floor(xp / 100)) and % to next level
   - Use a progress bar with glowing fill and level indicator badge
   - Grid layout for responsive design

2. **`/log`**
   - A floating card form UI to log new XP:
     - Domain (dropdown)
     - Task name (text)
     - XP (number)
     - Submit button ‚Üí appends to `data/log.json` and redirects to `/`
   - Form should have animated feedback (toast or animation on success)

3. **`/quests`**
   - Show active quests (loaded from `data/quests.json`)
   - Each quest card includes:
     - Domain
     - Description
     - XP reward
     - Checkbox to mark as complete ‚Üí auto-logs XP to that domain
   - Completed quests should fade out or display a ‚úÖ animation

---

### üß† Logic Requirements

- `lib/xpUtils.ts`:
  - Load XP from `log.json`
  - Calculate level and % to next level
  - Add XP to logs (append to file)
  - Optional: auto-calculate daily XP or streaks later

- XP formula: `level = floor(totalXP / 100)`, `progress = totalXP % 100`
